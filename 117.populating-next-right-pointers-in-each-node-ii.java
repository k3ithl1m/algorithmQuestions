 * Testcase Example:  '{}'
 *
 * Given a binary tree
 * 
 * 
 * struct TreeLinkNode {
 * ⁠ TreeLinkNode *left;
 * ⁠ TreeLinkNode *right;
 * ⁠ TreeLinkNode *next;
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
 * next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * 
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra
 * space for this problem.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Given the following binary tree,
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠    1
 * ⁠  /  \
 * ⁠ 2    3
 * ⁠/ \    \
 * 4   5    7
 * 
 * 
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 * 
 * 
 * ⁠    1 -> NULL
 * ⁠  /  \
 * ⁠ 2 -> 3 -> NULL
 * ⁠/ \    \
 * 4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
 *
