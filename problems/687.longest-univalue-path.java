 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in
 * the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the
 * root.
 * 
 * Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of
 * edges between them.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * ⁠             5
 * ⁠            / \
 * ⁠           4   5
 * ⁠          / \   \
 * ⁠         1   1   5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * 2
 * 
 * 
 *

 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * ⁠             1
 * ⁠            / \
 * ⁠           4   5
 * ⁠          / \   \
 * ⁠         4   4   5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * 2

 * Note:
 * The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes.  The height of the tree
 * is not more than 1000.
