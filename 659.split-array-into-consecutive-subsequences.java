 *
 * You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain
 * duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each
 * subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you
 * can make such a split.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
 * 1, 2, 3
 * 3, 4, 5
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
 * Output: True
 * Explanation:
 * You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 * 3, 4, 5

 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]
